# Voice

## Input and output
Input: localized script, language and voice configuration if generating.
Output: TTS-ready input and expected spoken/display mappings; an audio record only when audio was actually generated.
Read the [contract](../vidkit-pipeline/references/handoff-contract.md) and [Eleven v3 guide](references/eleven-v3.md).

## Workflow
1. Preserve clean editorial narration. Prepare the expected spoken version for numbers, abbreviations and difficult names while retaining their display spellings.
2. Add restrained delivery tags and punctuation for clear, emphasized technology explanation. Keep visual instructions outside the TTS input.
3. Use eleven_v3; start with Natural delivery unless configured otherwise. Use the supplied language-appropriate voice ID, never an invented example ID.
4. If an authorized client and budget exist, generate a coherent narration take. Otherwise deliver prepared text and required configuration only.
5. Finish narration edits/joins before transcription. Record the final audio identity and duration when measurable.
6. Hand off final MP3 to [transcript](../vidkit-transcript/SKILL.md); do not replace the agreed STT stage with TTS timestamps.

## Completion and missing inputs
Text preparation can complete without a voice ID or API client; generation cannot. Label these states separately. Missing credentials are configuration dependencies, not content to paste into a document.

If narration is wrong, preserve the faulty take and findings; follow the shared retry budget. Do not conceal spoken mistakes by altering captions. Music/SFX remain separate tracks.
